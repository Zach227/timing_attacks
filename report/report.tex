\section{Introduction}

% brief intro to timing attacks
Timing attacks are a type of side-channel attack.

% our goal 
To further learn about timing attacks, we implemented two simple attacks that exploit a non-constant compare function to extract a secret key.

% our inspiration
Our source of inspiration is Joe Grand, who demonstrated a simple timing attack \cite{video_key}. % Todo explain the timing attack he did

\section{FPGA to MCU}

\section{Human to FPGA}

The purpose of the human-to-FPGA timing attack is to see if it's possible to carry out a toy timing attack using a human and FPGA. % this sentence is kinda dumb
The non-constant compare function is implemented on an FPGA and we manually use an oscilloscope to measure time for each compare.

\section{Conclusion}

\section*{Acknowledgment}

Dr. Goeders taught us everything we know about hardware security.
